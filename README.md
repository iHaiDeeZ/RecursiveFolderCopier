# RecursiveFolderCopier
This is a simple tool done for learning the basics of C programming. The tool copies a folder recursively meaning that it would copy the whole folder and its content to another folder.

**Limits
- only text extension types could be copied since it will copy files char by char. Encrypted extensions like exe and pdfs won't be functional.
examples:
.c,.txt,.m, and MAKEFILE.
# How to Use

Put the folder path wanted to be copied, i.e:

**C:\user\xxxx\GAY**

Put the folder destination:

**F:\GAY**

it Will do the work for you.
